        Amsterdam, the Netherlands' capital, is one of the world's best hangout
        spots, a place where you can immerse yourself in culture, history, art,
        in the head of a beer or a self-rolled smoke.

      <p>
        For a fairly small city, Amsterdam has a surprisingly large number of
        museums and galleries.Traditional art-lovers know the route to the
        Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. But modern art too is richly
        represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and the Cobra museum
        in Amstelveen to name just two. There is a plenty of galleries,
        especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan. And if you want to
        experience more of nature, then the gardens of the universities and
        Artis Zoo are the right addresses. In a nutshell, there are lot of
        things to see in Amsterdam.

      <h2 class="grayText">Amsterdam Canals and Waterways</h2>
      <p>
        From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody the
        very spirit of Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges,
        including the famous Magere Brug, a traditionally stylled lift bridge.
        You can simply relax at a canalside café and watch an array of boats
        float by, or take a canal tour.
