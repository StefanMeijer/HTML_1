        represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and the Cobra museum

        things to see in Amsterdam.

      <h2>Amsterdam Canals and Waterways</h2>
      <p>
        From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody the
        very spirit of Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges,
        including the famous Magere Brug, a traditionally stylled lift bridge.
        You can simply relax at a canalside caf√© and watch an array of boats
        float by, or take a canal tour.
