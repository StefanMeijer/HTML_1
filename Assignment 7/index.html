            Amsterdam, the Netherlands' capital, is one of the world's best
            hangout spots, a place where you can immerse yourself in culture,
            history, art, in the head of a beer or a self-rolled smoke.
            Amsterdam is situated 20 km from the sea, at the point where river
            Amstel joins the river IJ. The city has a population of about
            750,000 and is the country's second largest port - after Rotterdam.
            Amsterdam is at the centre of a part of the Netherlands where there
            are many places of interest within easy reach.

          <h2>Amsterdam museums</h2>
          <p>
            For a fairly small city, Amsterdam has a surprisingly large number
            of museums and galleries.Traditional art-lovers know the route to
            the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. But modern art too is
            richly represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and the
            Cobra museum in Amstelveen to name just two. There is a plenty of
            galleries, especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan. And
            if you want to experience more of nature, then the gardens of the
            universities and Artis Zoo are the right addresses. In a nutshell,
            there are lot of things to see in Amsterdam.

          <h2>Amsterdam Canals and Waterways</h2>
          <p>
            From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody
            the very spirit of Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful
            bridges, including the famous Magere Brug, a traditionally stylled
            lift bridge. You can simply relax at a canalside caf√© and watch an
            array of boats float by, or take a canal tour.
